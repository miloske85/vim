# VIM configuration 

To use, clone to some folder, eg. /usr/local/vim_local and symlink `_vimrc` file to your home directory.
`ln -s /usr/local/vim_local/_vimrc ~/.vimrc`

To add colors to vim, add them to ~/.vim/colors.
`ln -s /usr/local/vim_local/colors ~/.vim/colors`

To use syntax highlighting add symlink of syntax folder to ~/.vim/
`ln -s /usr/loca/vim_local/syntax ~/.vim/syntax`
Enjoy!
